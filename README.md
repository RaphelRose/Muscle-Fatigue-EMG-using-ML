# Muscle-Fatigue-EMG-using-ML
## Abstract
Muscle fatigue is a commonly observed phenomenon in muscles when exposed to repeated or prolonged contractions, causing reduced muscle performance and increased susceptibility to injuries. Early detection of muscle fatigue is critical in most sports where it improves performance and prevents injury and healthcare, where it facilitates the monitoring and rehabilitation of patients. Electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive tool for evaluating muscle activity by recording electrical signals generated during muscle contractions. This will provide valuable insights for identifying muscle fatigue. This project introduces a machine learning-based approach, specifically implementing Support vector machine (SVM), for the EMG signals classification of the muscle fatigue. Our scope is to develop a proper and robust model that enables the EMG signals to accurately classify the states as both fatigued and non-fatigued. The methodology includes: preprocessing of the EMG dataset, extraction of key features, and applying a machine learning model for accomplishing the classification. 
## Methodology
## 1. Dataset Collection  
- **Baseline EMG Signals:** Collected from resting conditions.  
- **Fatigue EMG Signals:** Collected while lifting a load with elbow flexed.  

## 2. Preprocessing  
- Raw EMG signals are filtered and standardized.  
- The first dataset requires preprocessing, while the second is already clean.
